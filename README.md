# Redox-Switchable-Y-In-Complexes

Investigating the activities of redox-switchable yttrium and indium alkoxide
complexes during ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters.
- Synthesized ferrocene-based Schiff ligands in anaerobic glovebox
and aerobic conditions to support yttrium and indium complexes.
- Characterization of purified yttrium and indium complexes.
- Performed ring-opening polymerization of various cyclic esters
with the metal complexes in their reduced and oxidized states to
observe their selectively towards the monomers.
